# Lovely-Homepage
just a homepage for personal use, i made it cause i thout it would be fun an am curently learniing web dev stuff so not the best by any means. i might update it to look better although i dont curently know if i will

i was pataly inspiered by the bento homepage and loved how it was done with it being a webpage though i copied no code from them https://github.com/migueravila/Bento . and the pfp is just the pink floyd alblum "dark side of the moon" which i love
